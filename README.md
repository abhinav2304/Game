# Avoid the Falling Obstacles Game

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for a simple game titled "Avoid the Falling Obstacles," developed using Pygame. The game features a player who must dodge falling enemies. It includes a basic implementation of Q-learning for decision-making.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NumPy

## Installation
To run this game, you need to install Python and the necessary libraries. You can install Pygame and NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Usage
To play the game, clone this repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]
python avoid_falling_obstacles.py
```

## Game Description
- The player is represented as a blue square at the bottom of the screen.
- Enemies, represented as red squares, fall from the top of the screen.
- The player can move left or right to avoid colliding with the enemies.
- The game uses Q-learning for making decisions, with the player's actions (left, stay, right) based on the current state.

## Q-Learning Implementation
- The script includes a basic Q-learning algorithm to control the player.
- The Q-table is initialized to zeros and updated as the game progresses.
- Rewards are given for avoiding obstacles, and a large negative reward is given for collisions.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the Q-learning algorithm for better decision-making.
- Add more features like different levels, scores, and enhanced enemy behaviors.
