1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Use Python with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.
   - Use OpenAI's Gym for game environments.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - `main.py`: Main script to run the game.
   - `agent.py`: Defines the learning agent.
   - `model.py`: Neural network model for the agent.
   - `train.py`: Script to train the agent.

3. **Execution Steps**:
   - Install necessary libraries (`gym`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`).
   - Define the neural network model in `model.py`.
   - Create the agent in `agent.py` that learns from the environment.
   - Train the model in `train.py`.
   - Run `main.py` to see the agent playing the game.
